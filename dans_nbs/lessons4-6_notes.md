    import matplotlib.pyplot

ploting calls currenty expect 

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

A few typos, formatting issues

Small formatting problem here in the "Creating Functions section"__And if you want an integer result from division in Python 3, use a double-slash: ~ {.python} 4//2 {.output} 2 {.python} 3//2 {.output} 1 ~__

...That seems almost right: the original mean was about 6.1, so the lower bound from zero is __how__ about -6.1
